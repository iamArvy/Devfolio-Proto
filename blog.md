# Architecting a Scalable AWS Infrastructure with CloudFormation

## Introduction

In this article, we will explore an AWS infrastructure architecture designed to support a scalable and secure microservices-based application using CloudFormation. This architecture lays the foundation for running containerized workloads, handling high traffic efficiently, and ensuring security with proper network segmentation.

## Overview of the Architecture

This architecture consists of:

- **Amazon VPC** with public and private subnets for isolating resources.
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)** to distribute traffic across services.
- **ECS Cluster (EC2-based)** for running containerized applications.
- **RDS Database (PostgreSQL)** for persistent data storage.
- **IAM Roles and Security Groups** for access control.
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** for securely storing credentials.

## Network Infrastructure

### VPC and Subnets
The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is the backbone of the architecture. It is divided into:
- **Public Subnets**: Used for hosting public-facing resources such as the ALB.
- **Private Subnets**: Used for running application containers and databases securely.

#### Key Resources:
- **VPC**: CIDR Block `10.0.0.0/20`
- **Public Subnets**: `10.0.1.0/24` and `10.0.2.0/24`
- **Private Subnets**: `10.0.8.0/24` and `10.0.9.0/24`

### Routing and Internet Gateway
- **Internet Gateway** is attached to the VPC, allowing outbound traffic from the public subnets.
- **Route Tables** ensure proper routing of traffic between public and private resources.

## Compute Infrastructure

### Elastic Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Public-facing ALB** distributes HTTP traffic to the ECS services.
- Configured with security groups to allow only necessary inbound traffic.

### ECS Cluster (EC2-based)
- **Auto Scaling Group** ensures scalable EC2 instances for running containers.
- **ECS Capacity Provider** enables managed scaling.
- **IAM Roles** grant necessary permissions to ECS tasks.

## Database Layer

### Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)
- Hosted in private subnets to enhance security.
- Stores persistent application data.
- Uses **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** for managing credentials securely.

## Security Considerations

### Security Groups and IAM Roles
- **Load Balancer Security Group** allows inbound traffic only on port 80.
- **Container Host Security Group** restricts access to application instances.
- **RDS Security Group** allows connections only from ECS instances.
- **IAM Roles** enforce least privilege access to AWS resources.

## Conclusion

This AWS CloudFormation architecture provides a solid foundation for deploying scalable and secure containerized applications. By leveraging ECS, ALB, RDS, and well-structured networking, it ensures high availability and security while maintaining ease of management.
